# Heat-controlled multistability
Analyze data and generate figures for [Temperature-Responsive Multistable Metamaterials](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.1c07327) \[1]

This project defines and characterizes a model of a mechanical metamaterial based on experimental data of the metamaterial and its component materials. We import, clean, and analyze experimental data collected from standard materials testers, custom test fixtures, and ImageJ measurements and use it to map the metamaterial behavior across the relevant parameter range. The analysis script in the root directory can be run to regenerate nearly all of the analysis and related figures.
