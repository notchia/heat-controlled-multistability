Kept load zero from last time. Fixture-only reading is 0.02, at RT 23.8C. Same displacements as for the last several days of testing.
repeatability sample "2":
- weight, without magnets: 0.15 N
- 24.8C, 45.8C, 79.4

- weight, without magnets: 0.15 N
- Fixture-only reading is 0.05 at 24.5C
- 24.2C, 47.5C, 79.3C
h_constant, A:
- weight, with magnets: 0.21 N

# 09/07
Kept load zero from last time. Fixture-only reading is -0.03, but that is likely due to temperature change (it's 1 degree colder today than last time.
r_constant, A:
- weight, with magnets: 0.21 N
- 24.2C, 45.5C, 80.0C
- Took two of the high-temp one; noticed that the square was not fully folding out near the end, so that the hinges were in tension more than they should have been, and the top two squares seemed to get kind of stuck on each other (one corner wedged under the other). Happened both times though.
r_constant, B:
- weight, no magnets: 0.21 N
- 26.0C, 46.8C, 78.2C
- After this, realized pegs that I'd switch out were actually a little too large diameter??? So will have to retake A and B...
r_constant, C:
- weight, no magnets: 0.22 N
- 25.8C, 44.6C, 77.8C
r_constant, A, take 2:
- weight, no magnets: 0.21 N
- 25.4C, 46.6C, 79.5C
r_constant, B, take 2:
- weight, no magnets: 0.21 N
- 26.1C, 46.5C, 78.6C
Will not use first two of A and B.

# 09/06
Kept load zero from last time. Fixture-only reading is -0.06, but that is likely due to temperature change (it's 1 degree colder today than last time.
r_constant, B:
- weight, no magnets: 0.16 N
- 24.6C, 44.3C, 74.3C
r_constant, C:

- 25.3C, 46.2C, 79.7C
h_constant, A:
- weight, no magnets: 0.16 N

h_constant, B:
- weight, no magnets: 0.16 N

h_constant, C:
- weight, no magnets: 0.16 N
- 25.0C, 46.0C, 76.3C
- Fixture seems to have gotten out of alignment in these last two higher-temp values, though, maybe from unit being off-center, so not sure how trustworthy this last bit of data is... took photo right before very last test.

# 09/04
LCE inward on left/right hinges. 0.2 mmps. Zeroing fixture once at the beginning and not after that.
r_constant, A:
- weight, no magnets: 0.16 N
- 24.9C, 46.4C, 80.4C

# 09/03
Angle change of unit cells with temperature.
- h_constant: 24.3C, 46.1C, 83.0C
- r_constant: 24.3C, 46.1C, 82.8C

# 09/01
- This time, kept sample at roughly neutral position (6mm from compressed) while heating
- Same compression for both no magnets and magnets
## Sample1, no magnets
- Weight: 0.15 
- 23.5C, 15 minutes low fan to 44.4C
## Sample1, magnets
- Weight: 0.19
- 24.5C, 15 minutes low fan to 44.7C

# 08/25
Zeroed tensile fixture without anything in it. Loaded all unit cells such that LCE was facing inwards on the left and right hinges (outward on top and bottom). Before testing, heated magnets up to maximum temperature for 30 minutes (note that during this time, the empty grip load went up to 1.8N, from zero!)
From calibration photo, 30.705px2mm, so the starting compression for ALL samples is avg(12.39,12.64,12.84)=12.62 mm.
## Sample1, no magnets
- Weight: 0.13 +/- 0.01 (with markers)
- Calibration photo, then photo at max compression.
- 10 mm displacement from max compression for RT run, 8 for next run
- 25.1C, then gun at low fan, lowest setting for 20 minutes to equilibrate to 45.1. Accidentally clicked on the second setting for the lowest fan instead of switching to the high fan's lowest setting and overshot 100 degrees, so I stopped using this sample...
- Unscrewing process: -6 to open, unscrew bottom and move to front, -6 
## Sample2, no magnets
- Weight: 0.15 +/- 0.001 (no markers)
- 8 mm displacement
- 25.3C, 46.5C, 77.1C
## Sample2, no magnets
- Weight: 0.16 +/- 0.001 (no markers)
- 8 mm displacement
- Accidentally had to stop a test in between RT and first temperature, but it turns out the test still ran all the way through - based on photo of the new compressed state, it is the same as the original.
- 25.7C, 46.9C, 78.3C
## Sample1, with magnets
- Weight: 0.20 +/- 0.01
- 8 mm displacement
- 25.5C, 
## Record of temperature - load:
76.9,1.29
61.5,1.21

# 08/23/20
First test of updated (lighter) fixture and with mini oven.
LCE_tensile_sample1_24.3C_0.2mmps_1: Loaded sample into top grip, then bottom grip. RT, no door. Gauge length was around 20 mm, displacement was 1 mm. When returned to 0 mm, remained somewhat stretched. Probably should reduce displacement for next time. Took photo with ruler for calibration.
LCE_tensile_sample1_46.6C_0.2mmps_1: Unscrewed bottom grip, set heat gun to low air flow, lowest heat setting (nominally 65C), waited 10 minutes with door, re-screwed bottom grip, re-equilibrated for a few minutes, adjusted tension until looked straight. For some reason, load cell reading increased with temperature, all the way up to 0.3-0.4 N! Took photo. 
LCE_tensile_sample1_46.8C_0.2mmps_1: 1 mm seemed to be insufficient to register load change, so ran it again with 2 mm after waiting a few minutes for the sample to return to original length. No photo taken - same gauge length as previous.
LCE_tensile_sample1_77.2C_0.2mmps_1: Reduced displacement to buckle sample, set heat gun to high air flow, lowest heat setting (nominally 95C), waited 20 minutes with door, adjusted tension until looked straight. 2 mm displacement. Took photo.
LCE_tensile_sample1_76.9C_0.2mmps_1: Maybe didn't put in tension enough, so redid 2 mm displacement. Took photo.
PDMS_tensile_sample1_26.8C_0.2mmps_1: Load returned. Took photo

# 08/13/20
10 mm displacement
h=0.96, r=0.40, d=18.9, weight=0.160 (N), weight=0.230 (Y) 
h=1.30, r=0.30, d=18.9, weight=0.175 (N), weight=0.245 (Y)
h=1.73, r=0.22, d=18.9, weight=0.165 (N), weight=0.230 (Y)
3 tests for each N, two test for each Y

# 08/03/20
Weight: 0.17 N +- 0.01
11 mm displacement
0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1
Seeing load relaxation more in compression than in tension
